    "project_name": "Amphetamemes Quantum-Energetic Template System",
    "description": "A living, quantum-inspired art system generating dynamic, meme-driven lattices for viral social media engagement. Integrates sacred geometry (Fibonacci spirals, golden ratio Φ = 1.618), superpositioned quantum math (|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩), and glitchcore aesthetics. Features 10 energetic templates with embedded metrics (e.g., viral coefficient 2.8x-3.4x, energy score 0.85-0.97).",
